## Project Objective
This project was to create a web application that was to display our knowledge of Node, Express, MongoDB, and HTML. It also required us to perform CRUD operations on at least 2 Mong collections.

For our project, we elected to create Dater, an app for after the first date. End users can log dates with other users and answer questions to discover compatibility. Users can sign up to create an account, edit their account information, and delete their account. 

## Tech requirements
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
